elasticsearch:  URL to your elasticsearch server. You almost certainly don't·

                the same host
kibana_index:   The default ES index to use for storing Kibana specific object
                such as stored dashboards·
modules:        Panel modules to load. In the future these will be inferred·
                from your initial dashboard, though if you share dashboards you
                will probably need to list them all here·

If you need to configure the default dashboard, please see dashboards/default
